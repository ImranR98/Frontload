# Frontload

The frontend/client counterpart to [Backdraft](https://github.com/ImranR98/Backdraft). Far from complete; work in progress.

## TODO
- [ ] Settings page with account info, change email, change password, and view/revoke logins
- [ ] Visual overhaul - unique identity rather than demo for material UI
- [ ] Replace server-defined error messages with messages generated by client using error codes (allows for later internationalization)
- [ ] Internationalize client and add at least 1 other language (also need a way to determine default language and way to select language)
- [ ] Implement automated testing
- [ ] Create a proper README

# Frontload

The frontend/client counterpart to [Backdraft](https://github.com/ImranR98/Backdraft). Far from complete; work in progress.

## TODO
- [x] Settings page with account info, change email, change password, and view/revoke logins
- [x] Restructure project - break entire-page components up into smaller units; separate 'page' components from individual 'component' components
- [x] Replace server-defined error messages with messages generated by client using error codes (allows for later internationalization)
- [x] Visual overhaul - replace bootstrap and flex-layout with material UI
    - [x] Initial replacement
    - [x] Make revoke login prompt a bootstrap modal
- [ ] Further breakdown of account page into accountInfoComponent and loginListComponent
- [ ] Create password component (with params for passwordConfirm and if requirements should be enforced) and enforce requirement validation (in line with server)
- [ ] See if form input validation errors can be shown under the input
- [ ] Internationalize client and add at least 1 other language (also need a way to determine default language and way to select language) - must be done for all strings in TS and template files
- [ ] Implement automated testing
- [ ] Create a proper README
